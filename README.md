## Data Set

Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho


### Opens
* Why are so many predictions negative? 
* Why is intercept so large? What does that mean? `66008680.43`
* How can we further improve the model? 
* Should I've used a dataset from different file?

### TODOs
- [ ] Clean up the modeling Jupyter Notebook.
- [ ] Improve the model to provide more accurate predictions and better scores. 
- [ ] Create python app for dynamic predictions.
